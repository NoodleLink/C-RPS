# C-RPS
Silly little RPS text game I made to mess with C++
The coins I don't really know why I added, they're like a score I guess
What I have learned through this:
 - Setting up C++ for the first time (It was a pain)
 - Classes/Objects
    + I know they were unnecessary for this project but I used them to learn
 - Methods
 - Random number generation including a modulo
TO DO:
 - Comment
